#Project Details
I created a cryptocurrency watch app for this project. I picked quite a lot of advanced React & JavaScript knowledge while constructing it. Some of them are React Routers, Coin Gecko API, Chart JS for exhibiting charts for displaying regular frequency of currency, and Google Firebase for login and authentication needs.
For a dynamic user interface and iconography, it also makes use of Material UI.
This program assists the user in keeping track of all cryptocurrency values, changes over the last 24 hours, market capitalization, and other information. Everyone wants to invest in digital money in today's society, and this software aids them in deciding where to do so.
